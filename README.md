I made it a lot harder than I needed too. I knew all I had to do was update the github app with the vercel link, however I did this and everytime I tried to login I kept getting an error. It took me most of the day to realise I had a double // in the url when I changed it which was throwing it off and causing the error! Something I should've done in 10 minutes took me hours. A lesson learned!

EDIT!!

logging in on my localhost stopped working, i realised i didn't need to change the callback url on github app but i could just add one! had i seen the add callbark url button in the first instance, it would've saved me hours! So both localhost url callback and vercel url callback added and both working.
